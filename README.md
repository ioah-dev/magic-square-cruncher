# magic-square-cruncher
Python script to search for magic squares

The idea came from this video from the @numberphile YouTube channel:

First of all, I have to say that my math background is almost null.
I'd studied maths at highschool and I enjoy watching videos like this one on YT.

My coding skills are a little bit more extense but not much.

The goal is to make an app that given a range of values search for valid magic
squares formed by numbers in that range.

Once working and made it sort of efficient, implement the idea of all numbers 
used are square numbers.
